#Unraid Plug-ins

##Information
###mkvtoolnix
This plugin is a work in progress. So far, the plugin will only install mkvtoolnix for console use. There is a very simple webinterface included, but so far it is not finished.

###inadyn
This plugin will set dyndns services on your unraid system. Sadly it's not very stable and it becomes unresponsive after about a week. I will have to look into it.

###drive_mount
This plugin will let you mount a disk, which is not part of your array. In the future, there will be more features like adding shares automaticaly after mounting.

They are currently maintained by Influencer (but I still add a feature here and there or fix a bug or two ;) )

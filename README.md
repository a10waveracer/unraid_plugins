#Unraid Plug-ins

##Information
###mkvtoolnix
This plugin is a work in progress. So far, the plugin will only install mkvtoolnix for console use. There is a very simple webinterface included, but so far it is not finished.

###inadyn
This plugin will set dyndns services on your unraid system. Sadly it's not very stable and it becomes unresponsive after about a week. I will have to look into it.

###drive_mount
This plugin will let you mount a disk, which is not part of your array. In the future, there will be more features like adding shares automaticaly after mounting.

###plexupdater
This plugin will download and install the latest version of the plex media server addon.

##Simple Features
I recommend to install the Simple Features plugin, since my plugin will make use of some features included in Simple Features.
Plugins, which need Simple Features to work properly, will have a "_sf" in their name.
You can find the most recent version of Simple Features on http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=12698.0

##Other Plugins
Several other plugins I created are now hosted here: [UNplugged plugins](https://github.com/Influencer/UNplugged)
They are currently maintained by Influencer (but I still add a feature here and there or fix a bug or two ;) )

##Support
If you want support with one of my plugins, please open a ticket.
